This is a project that is not released but is under active development.

## Active
<a href="/project_status/" class="btn btn-success project-status"><i class="fa fa-play"> Active</i></a>

This is a project that is under active development and has at least one active public release, check the project repository or the project page for more details.

## On Hold
<a href="/project_status/" class="btn btn-info project-status"><i class="fa fa-pause"> On Hold</i></a>

This is a project that is **not** under active development with at least one active public release where future development is planned.

## Abandoned
<a href="/project_status/" class="btn btn-warning project-status"><i class="fa fa-pause"> Abandoned</i></a>

This is a project that is **not** under active development with at least one active public release where future development is **not** planned.  These projects are probably looking for a new owner, contact me for details.

This is a project that is **not** under active development with or without any public release where future development is **not** planned and the code base has been retired permanently.  These projects are not looking for a new owner however feel free to contact me anyway if you are interested in taking the codebase.

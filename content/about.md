BeyondVM is a personal blog is about virtualization, system administration and systems archetecture and the business of IT. I post research that I do into better management of virtualization and infrastructure, as well as things that I learn along the way. I also post news and information about the industry and the growing case for businesses using virtualization (and how it can fit into any organization). My ultimate goal is to post articles and tutorials that will be interesting to the seasoned professional and that can help people new to virtualization and other new technologies find their way.

### About Me:
